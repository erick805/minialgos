'''
Write a traversal function that prints a one-dimensional array of all the numbeers within the
given matrix. The matrix is a two dimensional array with array's as child elements of the matrix.
Assuming the zig zag order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes down
by one element, and proceeds to traverse in a zig zag pattern all the way to the bottom right corner.

Input: matrix =
[
  [1,3,4,10],
  [2,5,9,11],
  [6,8,12,15],
  [7,13,14,16]
]

Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]
