'''
You are given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children Nodes. When put together, Nodes form a
simple tree-like structure. Implement the breadthFirstSearch method on the Node class, which takes in an empty array,
traverses the tree using the Breadth-first Search approach(specifically navigating the tree from left to right),
stores all of the Node's names in the input array, and returns it.

Input:   A
       / | \
      B  C  D
    /  \   / \
   E   F  G   H
      / \  \
     I   J  K

Output: ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K"]
