/*
Suppose you have a sorted array in ascending order that is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return it's index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicates exist in the array.
The algorithm's runtime complexity must be O(logn) or less.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
