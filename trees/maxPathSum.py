'''
Write a function that takes in a binary tree and returns its max path sum. A path is a collection of connected nodes
where no node is connected to more than two other nodes; a path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes in a
particular path. Each binary tree node has a value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored
in properties called "left" and "right", respectively. Children nodes can either be binary tree nodes themselves or
the None(null) value.
