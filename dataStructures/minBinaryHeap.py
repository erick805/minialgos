'''
Implement a Min Heap class. The class should support insertion, removal(of the minimum/root value),
peeking(of the minimum/root value), as well as sifting a value up and down the heap and building the heap
from an input array. The heap should be represented in the form of an array.

Input: array = [48,12,24,7,8,-5,24,391,24,56,2,6,8,41]

buildHeap(array)
insert(76)
remove()
remove()
insert(87)

Output:

[-5,2,6,7,8,8,24,391,24,56,12,24,48,41]
[-5,2,6,7,8,8,24,391,24,56,12,24,48,41,76]
[2,6,7,24,8,8,24,391,76,56,12,24,48,41]
[6,7,8,24,8,24,24,391,76,56,12,41,48]
[6,7,8,24,8,24,24,391,76,56,12,41,48,87]
